# ðŸŽ¯ FocusFlow Extension

A personal browser extension to limit distractions, enforce focused YouTube watching, and build better online habits â€” built gradually during exam prep.

## ðŸŒŸ Core Features

- Per-site time limits
- 5-min grace periods
- YouTube-specific behavior tracking
- Nudges to discourage video hoarding
- Simple interface with smart logic

## ðŸš§ Status: Design & Planning Phase

I'm currently preparing for exams, so this project will grow slowly. Right now, it's a space for design ideas and reflection, with a goal to build the extension later using open-source tools and help.

## ðŸ§  Why I'm Making This

I noticed my time often slips away while watching "just one more video." I want to build an extension that holds me accountable â€” while being kind, not forceful.
